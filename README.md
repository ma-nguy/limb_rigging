# limb_rigging
Script for creating a limb rig structure in Python

This is a repository only to showcase my code for automating my rigging process for limbs on bipeds.
There is a main-file which consists functions that handle:
- initial joint-chain generation
- FK-IK-Blending
- FK-IK-Control creation
- Visbility switch
- Stretch-function
- Twist-joint generation + spacing inside the stretch

One last thing I want to add to the twist-mechanic-function, but for this showcase, this code is enough.
